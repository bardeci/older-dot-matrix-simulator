Cheats
------------------------------------------------

Gambatte supports Game Genie and Game Shark
cheat codes. Each cheat system has its own menu.

Game Genie cheats:
------------------------

Game Genie codes can have 6 or 9 digits. They 
are applied once each and they can only be 
disabled by exiting the emulator and reloading 
the ROM.

To introduce a code, go to the Game Genie menu, 
highlight a code line and press A to enter edit 
mode. While in edit mode you can change the 
value of each digit by using the D-Pad.
When you're done, press A to save the changes 
or B do discard them.

If you're introducing a 6-digit code, just leave
the last 3 digits as zeroes and your code will 
be detected as a 6-digit code. If all digits are 
zeroes, the code is ignored.

There are up to 20 lines for introducing several
codes at once if you need to.

To apply the cheats, press Start, and then 
confirm the action by pressing A. The codes will
then be applied and the code list will be
cleared.

Cheat codes are not saved on emulator exit.

Game Shark cheats:
------------------------

Game Shark codes have 8 digits. They can be
enabled and disabled at any time.

To introduce a code, go to the Game Shark menu, 
highlight a code line and press A to enter edit 
mode. While in edit mode you can change the 
value of each digit by using the D-Pad.
When you're done, press A to save the changes 
or B do discard them.

If all digits are zeroes, the code is ignored.

There are up to 20 lines for introducing several
codes.

To enable the cheats, select the slot on the 
left of the codes and press A to toggle the 
desired cheat on and off. An empty slot means 
the cheat code is disabled, while a check mark
means it is enabled.

Cheat codes are not saved on emulator exit.
